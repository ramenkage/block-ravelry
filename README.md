# Block Ravelry
A simple userscript for avoiding Ravelry.

The userscript pops up a dialog on the first visit to Ravelry in any tab, asking if you really want to load the site. This may be helpful for some users with accessibility concerns who wish to avoid accidentally following links to Ravelry.

## Compatibility
This script has been thoroughly tested using Greasemonkey in Firefox for Windows. It should still work with other userscript managers and other browsers. If you run across any problems, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ramenkage/block-ravelry/issues).

## Installation instructions
Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) in Firefox (recommended) or another [userscript manager](https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO#how-do-i-get-going-) in your browser of choice. Then, simply load the [block-ravelry.user.js](https://github.com/ramenkage/block-ravelry/raw/main/block-ravelry.user.js) file from this repository and approve the installation.

Once the userscript is installed, you can verify it's working by visiting [Ravelry](https://ravelry.com). A dialog box should appear before the page loads asking if you want to continue to Ravelry or return to the previous page.
